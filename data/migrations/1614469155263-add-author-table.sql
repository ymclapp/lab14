--Query 1: 
CREATE TABLE AUTHORS (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));

--This query will create a second table in the lab14_normal database named authors. Confirm the success of this command by typing \d authors in your SQL shell. You should see the authors table schema, as shown above.
--Query 2: 
INSERT INTO authors(name) SELECT DISTINCT author FROM books;

--This query will use a simple subquery to retrieve unique author values from the books table and insert each one into the authors table in the name column. This is a great pattern for copying lots of data between tables.
--Confirm the success of this command by typing SELECT COUNT(*) FROM authors; in your SQL shell. The number should be greater than zero.
--Query 3: 
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN author_id INT;

--This query will add a column to the books table named author_id. This will connect each book to a specific author in the other table.
--Confirm the success of this command by typing \d books in your SQL shell. The table schema should now include a column for author_id, in addition to the column for the string author; the author column will be removed in Query 5.
--Query 4: 
UPDATE books SET author_id=author.id FROM (SELECT * FROM authors) AS author WHERE books.author = author.name;

--This query will prepare a connection between the two tables. It works by running a subquery for every row in the books table. The subquery finds the author row that has a name matching the current book's author value. The id of that author row is then set as the value of the author_id property in the current book row.
--Confirm the success of this command by typing SELECT author_id FROM books; in your SQL shell. The result should display a column containing the unique ids for the authors. The numbers should match the total number returned from Query 2 when you confirmed the success of the insertion of names into the authors table.
--Query 5: 
ALTER TABLE books DROP COLUMN author;

--his query will modify the books table by removing the column named author. Now that the books table contains a author_id column which will become a foreign key, your table does not need to contain a string representing each author.
--Confirm the success of this command by typing \d books in your SQL shell. The books table schema should be updated to reflect the schema provided above, without the author column.
--Query 6: 
ALTER TABLE books ADD CONSTRAINT fk_authors FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(id);

--This query will modify the data type of the author_id in the books table, setting it as a foreign key which references the primary key in the authors table. Now PostgreSQL knows HOW these 2 tables are connected.
--Confirm the success of this command by typing \d books in your SQL shell. You should see details about the foreign key constraints, as shown in the schema above.
